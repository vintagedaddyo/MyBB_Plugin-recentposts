This mod will add the most recent posts of your forum at the top of your forum index. The permissions are carried intact. i.e. the group/groups that does/have not permissions to view a forum, will not be able to see the posts from the forum/forums that they are not allowed to view.

Also posts from forums set as Inactive will not show up. The same goes for the invisible posts too.

Installation. First unzip the mod package and ftp the inc folder inside to the root of your forum folder preserving the structure intact. Then to configure it go to your Acp->Configuration->Settings->Forum Home Options. Scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see 2 extra settings added. One is to turn the plugin on/off and the other to decide how many posts you would like to show at the Recent Posts Stats Box.
